This code book summarizes and explains the  data columns/variables  in this repository's file `tidydataset.txt`. This data set contains the mean for every combination of subject and activity  of all measures on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.


## ID variables

* `Subject` - The ID of the subject
* `Activity` - Activity that was being  performed at measurement time
